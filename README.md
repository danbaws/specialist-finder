# **Specialist Finder**

Welcome to my awesome project built using **SvelteKit**! üéâ  
This project is a fully functional platform that allows users to **book appointments with specialists** and ensures that data is properly managed in a **PostgreSQL** database. Below you'll find an overview of the website's functionality and a showcase of its features!

## üñ•Ô∏è **Website Features**

### 1. **Frontend Overview**
The frontend of the site is built with **SvelteKit**, offering a smooth and modern experience for users to browse services and make bookings. The website provides an intuitive interface to:
- View available services.
- Select and book an appointment with a specialist in the chosen field.
- Confirm the appointment and proceed with booking.

### 2. **Making a Reservation (Booking)**
Users can select a service, fill out the required fields (name, phone, address, and description of the problem), and schedule an appointment. After booking, the user receives a confirmation, and the data is stored in the database.

### 3. **Database Testing with PostgreSQL**
To ensure everything works smoothly, I tested the **PostgreSQL database** to confirm that the booking information is correctly saved. Here you can see the new booking entry being added to the database via the `psql` terminal.
